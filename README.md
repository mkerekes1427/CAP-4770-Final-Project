# CAP-4770-Final-Project
We did all of our coding within the Kaggle notebook and would push our changes to Github using Kaggle's "link to Github" and "save version" features.
We only had the one ipynb file, which contained our code and its output, as seen in our Github repository. The Kaggle notebook is actually connected to 
a Docker that has many libraries like pandas, sklearn, numpy, etc., so pip install is not necessary. It wasn't even necessary for XGBoost or Catboost, which 
was very convenient. The dataset was read in from the input section in the Kaggle notebook editor, and we had some saved predictions when we wanted to
add somehting to the notebook based upon prediction values, without running the whole notebook. The Kaggle link for the notebook is here:
